            <h2>I am a Computing Science student</h2>
            <p>I became interested in computer science during high school 
                when I took my first programming course and was fascinated 
                by the power of code to create and solve problems. 
                Since then, I have pursued numerous opportunities to learn more about the field, 
                I am excited to continue my studies and grow my knowledge and skills towards front end development. Happy coding :D</p>
